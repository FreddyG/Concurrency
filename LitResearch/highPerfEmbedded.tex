\section{Introduction}
Traditionally, high-performance and embedded computing have been entirely
seperate entities; back in the 1990s, phones could do little more than make
calls or send text messages, and nobody would consider running large data
analysis on their microwave. Recent advancements in the fields of multi-core
computing and general purpose GPU processing have started to blur this
distinction however. Phones and tablets often feature quadcore processors and
formidable GPUs, generally in a single SoC (System on a Chip) such as the NVidia
Tegra. High-end tablets can play beautiful looking games with resolutions
higher than most computer monitors can even handle, while phones are able to
offer a smoother web browsing experience than low-end laptops can. This paper
will shortly go over the benefits and challenges posed by this convergence.
